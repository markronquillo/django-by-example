`django.contrib.auth` 

AuthenticationMiddleware: Associates user with requests using sessions

#### Posting content from other websites
We are going to allow users to bookmark images from external websites. The user will provide the URL of the image, a title, and optional description. Our application will download the image and create a new Image object in the database.

This is how your users will add a bookmarklet to their browser and use it.
1. The user drags a link from your site to his browser's bookmarks.
2. The user navigates to any website and clicks the bookmark.
